          , I combined the word &quot;inazuma&quot; (稲妻), which means
          &quot;lightning&quot; in Japanese, with &quot;zine&quot; to create
          &quot;Inazine.&quot; At first, I thought this might be a bit wordy to
          say. But my partner said he actually likes it because you can tell
          people, &quot;That&apos;s a great idea, why don&apos;t you put that in
          a zine (Inazine)?&quot; I found this layer of pun to be quite funny
          and decided to stick with it.
